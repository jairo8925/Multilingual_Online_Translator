# Multilingual Online Translator

An app that translates a word and gives many usage examples. Requests connection to
https://context.reverso.net/translation/ and uses BS4 to scrape and parse translations
and sentence usage examples.

There are two options. One is through using command-line arguments as follows:
<br></br>
```python translator.py {source language} {target language} {word}```
<br></br>
The other is by running the program and providing input according to instructions.
